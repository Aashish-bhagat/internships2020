These are conceptual questions, and not programming tasks. In each of the following questions, we are looking for basic explanations, but please note that demonstrating with code examples is the ultimate winning strategy. 

### Data Serialization using Kyro

1. What is the meaning of serialization (or deserialization) of Data?
2. ~~Kyro is a popular Serialization framework used across many Java applications such as Apache Flu, Hive, Spark and others. It is also used in Scala and Objective C applications.~~
3. ~~Write a small application demonstrating the use of Serialization using~~
4. Name 3 frameworks or libraries which are most used for handling serialization in Java applications.

### Java Build Tools
As Java projects become bigger, they require build tools. Historically, Apache Ant, Maven and Gradle have been popular build tools. 
1. Why are build tools required?
2. What is the difference between Ant, Maven and Gradle?

### Jave Metrics 

### XML, JSON and REST
1. XML and JSON are two popular formats for storing or sharing data over networked applications. In most cases, these are the input or output formats of serialization (or deserialization) discussed above. 
2. What are some popular frameworks or libraries for handling XML and JSON data in Java. Name 2 for each. 
3. What is the purpose of making an API RESTful? In Java JAX RS is a popular standard for implementing REST principles. What are some popular libraries used for writing RESTful APIs in Java, preferably the ones which follow the JAX RS standard?
4. What is the difference between websockets and HTTP based APIs?

### Dependency Injection
1. If you've used any Object Oriented Language, then you may have used constructors to instantiate an object of a class. Apart from constructors, dependency injection is another way of creating and providing objects, using something called Inversion of Control. What are some advantages of using Dependency Injection?
2. Class dependencies can be injected using Annotations in Java, without the use of any external framework, however, frameworks make the implementation more convenient. Name two popular frameworks for implementing Dependency Injection in Java. 

### log4J and SLF4J

### Graph Database

### Software Architecture
1. As you leave college and enter software industry, you'll often encounter the phrase software architecture. It is used to refer to a broad number of things and the definition is not very crisp. We would request you to try and understand what it means. Here are a few links talking about architecture

Share a small summary of what you understand from the above write ups. One of the tasks for our interns revolves around using and understanding the architecture of Hadoop YARN. 

### Distributed Applications
2. What do you know about Hadoop? 

Bigtable is a distributed wide column store originally described in [this paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf).

1. What is a wide column store?
2. How is it different from column stores?

Apart from being massively distributed, Google Bigtable is also offered on the cloud as part of Google Cloud Platform. 
1. Are there equivalent cloud offerings from Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, IBM and Oracle? If yes, what are their names?
2. Are there open source alternatives to Google Cloud Bigtable, which can be self hosted? If yes, what are their names?
